# Program Description

​Code/Astro is a week-long astronomy software development workshop. The goal of this program is to teach participants fundamental software engineering skills and best practices for building sustainable open-source packages for astronomy applications. During the workshop, participants will obtain hands-on experience with software engineering by developing a small software package from scratch. The workshop will also serve as a networking and career development opportunity. The workshop is free and open to folks at all career levels. Due to the current pandemic, the workshop will be held remotely. Code/Astro is supported by the Heising-Simons Foundation.

# ​Schedule

 The workshop will be held remotely via Zoom each day. Structured activities will occur from 9am-noon (PDT) each day. The rest of the time is unstructured and participants can work on their packages at their own pace. Topics covered each day are as follows:

| Monday 6/21   | Tuesday 6/22  | Wednesday 6/23  | Thursday 6/24  | Friday 6/25   |
| :------------ | :------------ | :-------------- | :------------- | :------------ |
| Programming Paradigms      | Git & GitHub            | Releasing Code          | Software Testing              | Industry Panel Discussion     |
| Python Package Tutorials   | Debugging               | Code Documentation      | Parallel Programming          | Project Presentations |
| Development Environments   |                         | Code Profiling          | Anti-Discriminatory Practices |        |

This year, participants will also be required to attend a 3-hour "setup" session the week before the workshop starts. We'll send out logistics for that as it gets closer.

The Industry Panel Discussion on Friday will start at 9am and consist of three panelists who have done software development in both academia and industry. Bring any questions you want to ask them!

# How to Apply

We require participants to be familiar with Python or another high-level programming language (e.g., Java, Matlab). Participants are expected to develop on their own computers and have set up their development environment there. The workshop will be held online via video conferencing. For those that require financial assistance in any way to participate (the workshop itself is free), please contact Jason Wang (jwang4@caltech.edu), as we have some funding support available. Anyone related to astronomy is eligible. 

**Applications have closed for 2021. All applicants should have received an email notification. **
