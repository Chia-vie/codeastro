# Day 1

## Project Goals for Today

 * Come up with an idea for a small Python package to work on for the week. The function can be simple (for example: a package to blur images). The goal for the package is to learn the steps to develope and publish this package. 
 * Start working on writing/designing the code. Think about how to structure your code: what should be a function and what should be a class?

## Learning Objectives

  * Identify which development environment is most appropriate for their programming task.
  * Decide when and how to design software using functional and object oriented paradigms.
  * Employ best practices for using numpy, pandas, matplotlib & astropy in open-source packages, and explain the purposes of each of these packages.
